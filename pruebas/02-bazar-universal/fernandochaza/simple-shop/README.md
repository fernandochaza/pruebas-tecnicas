# Simple Shop

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
<br>
This is a Next JS web application that simulates an e-commerce find and buy experience.  

*** IMPORTANT: The app is optimized for mobile device screens ***

I made it to practice my Frontend dev skills and to gain proficiency in the following technologies:

## Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Next.JS 13](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) - Using the brand new App Router paradigm
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- [Auto Animate](https://auto-animate.formkit.com/) - For subtle animations
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Live Demo
